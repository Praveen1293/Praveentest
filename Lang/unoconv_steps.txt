apt remove --purge libreoffice*
add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa
apt update
apt install libreoffice


Download the attached unoconv file
2. From the directory with the file run 
chmod ugo+x ./unoconv
3. Put a test doc file (for example, .doc or .docx) in the same directory
4. Run 
./unoconv -o result.pdf yourFile.doc 
where yourFile.doc is the name of the test doc file, and result.pdf is the name for the converted file
5. If you encounter an error 'Cannot find a suitable office installation on your system', install libreoffice with these commands: 
add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa 
apt update 
apt install libreoffice
6. Check the resulting file result.pdf - if everything worked and the file is okay, the unoconv version 0.8.2 can work in your environment and you can install it

To install unoconv 0.8.2 version:
1. Run 
apt purge unoconv
2. From the directory with the unoconv file run 
cp ./unoconv /usr/bin/
3. Check uploading doc or docx files in a VC on production (if the fix didn't help immediately, try again after restarting the server)
